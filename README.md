# React dApp Boilerplate

Features:
- React + Styled Components
- RainbowKit + Ethers + wagmi

## Quickstart

It is pretty easy to start working on top of it without learning anything new, just navigate to the `src/` dir and inspect the files that create the dApp.

### 1. Install dependencies
`npm install` or `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if you are getting errors.

### 2. Start dev server
`npm start`

### 3. Build
`npm build` - You will find built assets in the `dist/` directory.

### 4. Adjust esbuild configuration
As simple as editing `config/esbuild.js`
